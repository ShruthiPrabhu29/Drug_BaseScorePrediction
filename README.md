# Drug_BaseScorePrediction:
In this project we are going to predict the drug base_score based on the patients review and other features which are there in the csv file.
It has two files train.csv and test.csv.
We have trained the different models using train.csv and made the predictions for test.csv.
Among different algorithms, Random Forest(RF) and Decision Tree(DT) are performing well. We have predicted the results using both the algorithms and saved the results in results_RF.csv and results_DT.csv respctively.
